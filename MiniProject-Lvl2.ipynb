    "## Summary of the Question \n",
    "As above, but the program now takes chocolates from the table for its turn (say 3 every time it is run), remembering the initial value but also keeping track of the current number left (so uses 2 variables for this). The main method is structured as a sequence of calls to methods: 1) call a method to describe the rules 2) call a method to ask for the number of chocolates (this method returns their answer) 3) repeat their answer “There are 11 chocolates …” 4) Call a method to say the move (take 3). ).
