    "\n",
    "As above but the program also keeps an array of records. Each array entry corresponds to a number of chocolates left so possible state of the game. Each record has three boolean fields standing for “eat one chocolate”, “eat two chocolates” or “eat three chocolates’. All are set to true initially except for at array position one in which only the value for “eat one ..” is true; and array position two in which only “eat one…” and “eat two …” are true. The program then only makes moves on its turn corresponding to the record being true for that move. Array position 0 is not used. If the program makes a move and then immediately loses then the entry for that move is set to false. The program now resigns immediately if all booleans in the record for the current position are false (as all lead to losses). It then changes the boolean flag for its last move (to false so it won’t make that move again if in the same position)."
