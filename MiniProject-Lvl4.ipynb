    "As above, but the program now allows one move each and checks if there are no chocolates left after each move and says who won (if none left the last person to move wins - the loser is told to eat a chilli). The machine now makes a random move taking either 1, 2 or 3 chocolates based on the “roll” of a virtual dice. Write a separate method for the dice roll. If it is not the end of the game then the human player is asked to make a move. A separate ‘check for the end of the game’ method is passed the current number of chocolates as argument and prints the appropriate next thing to say."
